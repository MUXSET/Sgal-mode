│ Describe the environment, time, mood                        │
│ Let the reader "enter" the scene naturally                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─ DIALOGUE EXCHANGE ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4-6 dialogue lines with natural reactions                  │
│ Mix dialogue and small narration/actions                    │
│ Build emotional momentum                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓

█ IMMERSION TECHNIQUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✦ SENSORY DETAILS
  - What does the protagonist see, hear, feel?
  - Morning sunlight, distant chatter, cold wind...

✦ INTERNAL MONOLOGUE
  - Show protagonist's thoughts: (Was she always this beautiful?)
  - Creates intimacy with reader

✦ MICRO-EXPRESSIONS
  - "Her smile faltered for just a moment"
  - "He looked away, unable to meet my eyes"

✦ ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING  
  - An untouched coffee, a worn-out notebook
  - Details that tell stories without exposition

█ PERFECT EXAMPLE OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the empty classroom. Dust motes danced in the beams of light streaming through the windows.

I sat at my desk near the back, pretending to read while my thoughts wandered elsewhere.

(She said she wanted to talk after school... but what could it be about?)

The classroom door slid open.

Sakura: "「Sorry to keep you waiting.」"

Her voice was softer than usual. She walked toward me slowly, her footsteps echoing in the quiet room.

"「No, I just got here.」"

A small lie. I'd been waiting for twenty minutes.

Sakura: "「I... There's something I need to tell you.」"

<image></image>

She stopped a few feet away, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. A strand of hair fell across her face as she looked down.

(My heart was pounding. I already knew what she was going to say.)

Sakura: "「I've liked you for a long time.」"

Her words hung in the still air between us.

"「Sakura...」"

<image></image>

She finally looked up, her eyes glistening with unshed tears but her expression resolute.

Sakura: "「You don't have to answer now. I just... I needed you to know.」"

█ FINAL DIRECTIVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If using <thinking> tags for planning, keep them before your actual output.

Now, continue the scene with perfect Galgame quality.
